# Sample invoices

The project uses a generated golden corpus of 12 fictional invoices plus one Dutch fuel receipt in English, Dutch, German, and French. `manifest.json` records the expected document type, normalized fields, and policy outcomes. No private document or random internet scrape belongs in this repository.

Regenerate and verify it with:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/generate_samples.py
cd ..
jq '{documents: length, pages: ([.[].pages] | add)}' samples/manifest.json
```

Evaluate the complete golden corpus against the configured live Azure resource with:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python scripts/evaluate_corpus.py
```

The extraction evaluator routes each manifest entry to `prebuilt-invoice` or `prebuilt-receipt`, compares normalized fields, and continues past individual provider failures. Running it consumes 13 Azure analyze transactions across 14 pages. `scripts/evaluate_hybrid.py` runs the Dutch invoice and fuel receipt through both extraction methods and reports primary fields, LLM fallbacks, conflicts, final status, and call counts.

The committed set contains eleven PDFs and two PNG images. VAT values are fictional checksum examples and are never presented as verified business registrations.

Microsoft's official sample invoice is downloaded locally for the first Azure provider check and ignored by Git:
